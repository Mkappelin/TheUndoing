---- HIGH PRIORITY ----

- MagicianGameModeBase:
-- Remake the MagicianGameModeBase into a GameMode class

- MagicianPlayerController:
-- Make sure widgets in Tick() never are null
-- Change widget pointers to be UPROPERTY() members

---- Medium Priority ----

- MagicianGameModeBase:
-- In MagicianGameModeBase::SwitchPlayerController you blend after the swap (good), but if NewCamera is null you never restore the pawn view.
-- Consider calling ClientRestart(Pawn) on the new controller (owning client) after the swap

- MagicianPlayerController:
-- You mix Enhanced Input (character) with legacy input bindings (controller). That’s fine, but remember legacy “Action Mappings” must exist for "PaintButton" (Maybe Change)
